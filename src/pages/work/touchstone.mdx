# Touchstone

I led or assisted product design, ui/ux, and font-end development for this webapp built to help financial advisors understand their clients on a more personal level. Though this product had already been developed when I jumped on board, I quickly set out to identify sticking points in the user flow, reimagine the dashboard, and design a game.

## Design language

Though the overall design of the app evolved during my time working on it, we tried to stay fairly loyal to the original guidelines.

## Onboarding flow

I found the app challenging to navigate when I first joined the project. One of the ways I helped solve this problem was by outlining clearly the main tasks a user might wish to accomplish.

## New dashboard

Users in the role of Advisor got a completely new dashboard experience. Originally just a few stats depicting some Client data, we pitched the idea of giving a much deeper look into what was going on under the hood, including an activity feed and notifications for the most important upcoming events.

## Early concepts

The client initially asked us to try to work more color into the dashboard. In the end it they decided to stick with a simpler direction.

## Big picture

We revamped the Client&rsquo;s landing page to showcase recent surveys but, most importantly, to help provide more insightful content about each person.

## Gathering data

Surveys are at the core of Touchstone. We worked and reworked certain aspects of how surveys look and function but, unfortunately, there was never a chance to completely rethink them.

## Engagement

In order to increase user engagement, I was responsible for redesigning the existing Category Game concept, as well as reworking the front-end code to be mobile friendly.

## Notifications &amp; Settings

We designed and implemented an all-new notification center to help Advisors keep track of important milestones amongst their clients.
