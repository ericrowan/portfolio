# Schmidt&rsquo;s

Interactive design and front-end development, working alongside Schmid&rsquo;s internal digital strategy team. Starting in a Portland, Oregon kitchen, Schmidt&rsquo;s natural soaps and deodorants can now be purchased in stores all over the world.

I lead the design on several projects while working with Schmid&rsquo;s, including on both new and existing features.

## Quick search

The client requested new search functionality that would help the user make sense of the growing list of products, article titles, and more. I designed an interactive search modal that new users would recognize and understand.

## Full-screen heroes

I was tasked with rethinking how the existing heroes would look and work at more of a full-screen size. Because the existing brand style relied heavily on text overlaid on large images, and due to the nature of background images in general, I ran into issues early on.

To solve this, we built features to allow content editors to set positioning options for their headings and calls to action.

We also provided options for responsive layouts.
