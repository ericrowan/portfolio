# Siteworks

Visual and interactive design, along with typography, were some of the ways I helped OMFGCo. when they reached out for help on a website build for their fellow Portland-based client, Siteworks.

I was tasked with doing a UX design audit on the website mockups, already in a pretty good spot, and worked with OMFGCo. to refine some key areas of the website, such as general design suggestions and improvements to typography.

## Interactive map

I also led UI/UX design on an interactive map that was requested by the client. The map provides users with the ability to view a portfolio of work from Siteworks in a useful way.
