# Scag Mower Parts

Front-end development, UI/UX design. Demo project created in conjunction with the design phase to gain confidence in working with new front-end tooling, [Gridsome.js](https://gridsome.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This was an experiment of moving fast, getting rough design ideas nailed down in Figma and immediately jumping into rapid prototyping.

Using Gridsome and Tailwind together was super liberating, helping avoid managing dozens of screens and user flows in a design program like Figma or Adobe XD. As great as those apps are, just could not compete with this approach of building out a hybrid design/wireframe/prototype experience.

Check out the embedded demo.
