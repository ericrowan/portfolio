# Changelog

Branding, visual design, and front-end development for a podcasting startup targed at a tightknit community of developers. Over the course of several months, I collaborated with a small team internally and externally to continue pushing an already well-established brand&rsquo;s look and feel forward.

## Podcast heroes

Tasked with refining the podcast pages and heroes. My goal was to bring focus to actionable items, enhance visual appeal of the podcast artwork, and boost importance of community member avatars.

## Improved comments

I helped design and build a new comment thread, allowing for the use of Markdown and, crucially, emojis.
