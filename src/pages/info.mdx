### I&rsquo;m a design lead specializing in product, interactive, and UX engineering. Currently based in Oakland, Calif.

Here&rsquo;s a current <a href="../images/resume-2019.pdf">résumé</a>.

Over the past decade-plus, I&rsquo;ve worked alongside many other talented folks to help build useful tools on the web, and continue to refine my abilities and processes as a designer and developer.

I&rsquo;ve helped design and build apps used by +10k customers, led a redesign of the official website for a major US city, mentored and grew a city-sponsored coding school&rsquo;s web design course, and worked atonomously or with teams big and small to create new experiences or push existing ones forward.

Outside of work, I&rsquo;m into backpacking and similar pursuits that help me unplug and reconnect with nature when possible. Since moving to the west coast with my wife in early 2018, I continue to be blown by exploring the terrain around me on foot. In addition, there&rsquo;s also never enough time to seek out new foods and music.
