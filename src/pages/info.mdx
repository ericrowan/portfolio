Over the past decade-plus, I&rsquo;ve worked alongside many talented people to help build useful tools for everyone on the web. I&rsquo;ve continued to use that experience to refine my processes and interests as a designer and developer, and as a team member, ever since.

I&rsquo;ve helped design and build apps used by [+10k customers](http://indatus.com/solutions/answer-automation), led a redesign of the official website for a [major US city](https://www.nashville.gov/), mentored and grew a city-sponsored [coding school](https://codelouisville.org/)&rsquo;s web design course, and worked atonomously or with teams big and small to create new brand experiences or push existing ones forward.

Outside of work, I&rsquo;m an avid backpacker. Since relocating to the west coast from the midwest with my wife in early 2018, I continue to be blown away exploring the terrain. Finally, I&rsquo;d be remiss if I failed to mention the importance of seeking out new foods and music on the regular.
