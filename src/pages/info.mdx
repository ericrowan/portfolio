Over the past decade-plus, I&rsquo;ve worked alongside many talented people to help build useful tools for everyone on the web. I&rsquo;ve continued to refine my abilities and processes as a designer and developer ever since.

I&rsquo;ve helped design and build apps used by +10k customers, led a redesign of the official website for a major US city, mentored and grew a city-sponsored coding school&rsquo;s web design course, and worked atonomously or with teams big and small, to bring new ideas to life or to push existing ones forward.

Outside of work, I&rsquo;m an avid backpacker. Since relocating to the west coast from the midwest with my wife in early 2018, I continue to be blown away exploring the terrain. Finally, I&rsquo;d be remis if I failed to mention the importance of seeking out new foods and music.
