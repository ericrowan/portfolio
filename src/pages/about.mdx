### Design lead and front-end developer creating useful digital experiences.

For over a decade, I&rsquo;ve worked alongside many talented people to help build useful tools that are performant, beautiful, and accessible for everyone. I&rsquo;ve continued to use those experiences to refine my own processes and interests as a designer and developer, and as a team member.

I&rsquo;ve helped design and build apps used by [+12k customers](http://indatus.com/solutions/answer-automation), led a redesign of the official website for a [mid-sized city](https://www.nashville.gov/), mentored and grew a city-sponsored [coding school](https://codelouisville.org/)&rsquo;s web design course. I am comfortable working autonomously or with big teams and small, with clear direction and goals early on and without, to create engaging products and experiences.
